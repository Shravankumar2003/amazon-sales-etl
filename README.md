# Amazon Sales ETL ðŸš€

This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for Amazon sales data. The pipeline extracts data from Kaggle, transforms it using Jupyter Notebook, and loads the cleaned data into a SQL table for further analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Extract**:  
   The Amazon sales dataset is fetched from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

2. **Transform**:  
   The raw data is processed and cleaned using **Pandas** in a Jupyter Notebook.  
   The transformation process involves:
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type conversions
   - Aggregating and restructuring data for analysis

3. **Load**:  
   The transformed data is then loaded into a **SQL table** using **SQLAlchemy** for efficient querying and storage.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Importing data directly from Kaggle.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, processing, and structuring data using Pandas.
- **Data Loading**: Storing the processed data into a SQL database for deeper analysis.
